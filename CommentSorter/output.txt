Comment: I couldn't get the chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener event to fire... I'm /preeeetty/ sure that I did everything right... Maybe someone can help?

Here are some things I've tried:
- Put a console log inside the gotMessage function (doesn't fire)
- Put a console log inside the buttonClicked function (fires)
- Tried restarting Chrome (no effect)
- Disabled the other extensions on my browser (no effect)
- Restarted again (no effect)
- Copied the code from github (https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/tree/master/week10-chrome-ext/00_extension_basics_browser) (same problem)
- Tried console logs again - same problems.

Is it possible some of the Chrome extension standards have changed?

Love The Coding Train videos! Thank you so much for this awesome stuff!

Comment: Thank you!

     I'm making a Firefox add-on, but there are enough similarities that it's clearing up a lot of my confusion. One thing I'm still confused on is how to include the use of *jQuery* in your script, because currently it seems that my add-on just skips any jQuery code. Another question I have is how do you create things that you would normally use *HTML* to create?

     Yeah, you could use JavaScript to make simple HTML elements, but that could quickly become far too tedious with more complex applications.

Comment: I flowed this tutorial to make a Firefox extension. All I had to change was "chrome" into "browser".
So if you want to make a browser agnostic extension one thing you should do is

if (check_somehow_if_chrome_is_the_browser()) {
    browser = chrome;
}

And then you just use "browser" instead of "chrome".

In my browser action there is Popup.html with a button that calls a content.js witch tries to get data from web API. This communication is not like the background does, I mean, is directly loading in de actual website. The point is, how can I get info, for example an Array like the API provides and manage it to do things. Thanks.
